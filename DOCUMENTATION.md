Of course. This is an excellent project concept that fills a specific niche. Let's approach this with a professional engineering mindset.

# **Termux Panel: Professional Design Document**

## **1. Project Vision & Core Principles**

**Vision:** To create the definitive, lightweight, mobile-first control panel for managing services and applications on low-resource computing environments, starting with Termux on Android and extending to Raspberry Pi, SBCs, and micro VPS instances.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Resource Consciousness:** Every line of code and every dependency must justify its memory and CPU footprint.
2.  **Simplicity over Features:** Prioritize a few core functions that work flawlessly over a vast array of half-implemented features.
3.  **Portability:** The entire state of the panel and its managed apps should be contained in a simple, version-controllable directory.
4.  **Extensibility:** The architecture must allow the community to easily contribute and share application definitions.

---

## **2. Page & Feature Definitions**

*   **Dashboard (`/`)**
    *   **Content:** Key system stats (CPU, RAM, Disk) in a compact, glanceable format (e.g., progress bars). List of managed applications with their current status (Online, Stopped, Error) and quick actions (Start, Stop, Restart). System uptime.
    *   **Interaction:** All actions via HTMX for seamless updates.

*   **System Monitoring (`/system`)**
    *   **Content:** Detailed, auto-refreshing graphs/charts for CPU, Memory, and Disk I/O over time. Table of running processes (non-PM2), sortable by resource usage. Button to run garbage cleanup commands for Termux (`pkg clean`, `apt autoremove`).

*   **Apps Manager (`/apps`)**
    *   **Content:** Primary interface. Two main sections:
        1.  **Managed Apps:** List of apps currently installed and managed by PM2. CRUD operations for each.
        2.  **App Registry:** A searchable/filterable catalog of pre-defined applications (from `registry.json`). "Install" button that pre-populates a configuration modal.
    *   **Interaction:** "Install" fetches the app's config schema from the backend and renders a dynamic form using HTMX.

*   **Logs & Alerts (`/logs`)**
    *   **Content:** Dropdown to select a managed application. Real-time tail of the selected application's logs (stdout/stderr) using Server-Sent Events (SSE). Separate tab for PM2 logs and system alerts (e.g., high CPU usage for >5 min, app repeatedly crashing).

*   **Network / Tunnels (`/network`)**
    *   **Content:** Interface to start/stop a tunnel (LocalTunnel or Ngrok) for the Panel itself or for a specific managed app (port). Display the generated public URL. Basic firewall/port status display (`ss` or `netstat` output).

*   **Settings (`/settings`)**
    *   **Content:** Form to modify Panel configuration: HTTP port, theme (light/dark), refresh intervals. Section to import/export the `registry.json`. *Future: Authentication toggle (basic auth), API key generation.*

*   **User / Access Control (`/users`)**
    *   **Status:** **Phase 2 Feature**. Placeholder page. Design will be simple: username/password with role (Admin, Viewer). All auth stored encrypted in `lowdb`.

}
```

### **3.3. Core API Endpoints**

*   `GET /api/system/stats` -> `{ cpu, memory, disk, uptime }`
*   `GET /api/system/processes` -> `Array<Process>`
*   `GET /api/apps` -> `Array<App>` (from PM2 + lowdb metadata)
*   `POST /api/apps` -> Install new app (body: app config)
*   `POST /api/apps/:id/:action` (`start`, `stop`, `restart`, `delete`)
*   `GET /api/logs/:app_id` -> SSE stream of logs
*   `POST /api/tunnel/start` -> `{ url }`

### **3.4. Security Model (Initial & Future)**

*   **Phase 1 (Local Use):** No authentication by default. Assumes the device itself is the security boundary. Warning displayed on dashboard.
*   **Phase 2 (Remote Access):** **Mandatory** Basic HTTP authentication if a tunnel is active or the `--public` flag is used on startup. Credentials stored hashed in `users.json`.
*   **Phase 3 (Advanced):** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), API keys for programmatic access, and rate limiting on API endpoints.

### **3.5. Scaling & Degradation Strategy**

*   **Phone (Termux) vs. VPS (Linux):** The same codebase runs everywhere. The key difference is resource constraints.
*   **Scaling Down (Graceful Degradation):**
    *   **Configurable Polling Intervals:** Default monitoring refresh set to 10s. Can be increased to 60s+ on very low-end devices.
    *   **Lazy Loading:** The System Monitoring page, with its process list, is only fetched when the user navigates to it.
    *   **Optional Modules:** The tunnel manager code is only loaded if the `localtunnel` or `ngrok` package is found in `node_modules`.
    *   **Log Retention:** Logs are automatically rotated by PM2. The Panel's UI could limit real-time tailing to the last 100 lines.
    *   **Memory Warning:** The backend monitors its own memory usage. If it approaches a critical threshold (e.g., 80% of available RAM), it can disable non-essential features like real-time stats polling and serve a simplified UI.

---

## **4. Install Requirements & Resource Analysis**

### **4.1. Minimum Requirements**
*   **Node.js:** v16+
*   **PM2:** Installed globally (`npm i -g pm2`)
*   **Storage:** ~150 MB (for Node.js modules + Panel) + space for your apps and logs.
*   **RAM:** **Absolute Minimum:** 256 MB. **Recommended:** 512 MB+ for a comfortable experience with 1-2 small apps.

### **4.2. Resource Analysis (Estimated)**

| Module/Layer         | RAM Impact (Idle) | RAM Impact (Active) | Disk Space | CPU Load (Active Polling) | Notes                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Express Server**   | ~25 MB            | ~30 MB              | -          | Very Low                   | Base overhead.                                                        |
| **LowDB**            | ~5 MB             | ~10-15 MB           | Minimal    | Low                        | Scales with JSON file size. Reads are cheap, writes block.            |
| **System Monitoring**| -                 | +5-10 MB            | -          | **Medium-High**            | Polling `pidusage`/`os-utils` is the most expensive operation.        |
| **PM2 API Interaction** | -              | +2-5 MB             | -          | Low                        | Communicating with PM2's Daemon.                                      |
| **Tunnel Manager**   | -                 | +10-20 MB           | ~30 MB     | Low                        | Only loaded if used. `ngrok` binary has its own overhead.             |
| **Frontend (Served)**| -                 | -                   | < 1 MB     | -                          | Tiny, compressed HTML, JS, CSS.                                       |
| **TOTAL (Typical)**  | **~30 MB**        | **~60-80 MB**       | **~150 MB**| **Configurable**           | Without any managed apps. Very acceptable for a modern Android phone. |

**What happens if modules are heavy?**
*   **Slow Installs:** `npm install` on a low-end device can take time. We will provide pre-built binaries where possible in the registry.
*   **OOM (Out of Memory):** The degradation strategies (Section 3.5) are crucial. PM2 can also restart the Panel itself if it crashes.
*   **Termux Crashes:** This is a system-level constraint. The Panel will include a "Safe Mode" flag that disables all monitoring and non-essential features to get the system back under control.

---

## **5. DevOps & Contribution Strategy**

1.  **Standardized Registry:** The `registry.json` schema is the core contribution point. Community submits Pull Requests to the main repo to add new app definitions.
2.  **CLI Installer:** A one-line install script (`curl -sL https://get.termux-panel.io | bash`) that:
    *   Checks for Node.js + PM2, installs them if missing.
    *   Clones the repo or downloads a release tarball.
    *   Runs `npm install --production` (no dev dependencies).
    *   Starts the panel via PM2 and outputs the local URL.
3.  **Update Mechanism:** The Panel can check for updates (its own and the app registry) via GitHub API and guide the user through a CLI-based update process.

---

## **6. Final Step-by-Step Methodology (Pre-Coding)**

1.  **Repository Setup:** Initialize repo with `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), and issue templates.
2.  **Project Structure Scaffolding:**
    ```
    termux-panel/
    ├── bin/                 # CLI scripts (start, update)
    ├── src/
    │   ├── api/            # Express routers (system, apps, logs, tunnels)
    │   ├── services/       # Core logic (Pm2Service, MonitorService, etc.)
    │   ├── data/           # LowDB database files (created runtime)
    │   ├── public/         # Static files (HTMX, Tailwind, JS, favicon)
    │   │   └── views/      # HTML fragments for HTMX to swap
    │   └── app.js          # Express app setup
    ├── registry.json       # Default app registry
    ├── package.json
    └── config.json         # User configuration
    ```
3.  **Dependency Finalization:** Pin exact versions of critical dependencies for stability (`lowdb`, `express`, `pidusage`).
4.  **Prototype Core Service:** Implement the `MonitorService` (fetching CPU/RAM/Disk) and `Pm2Service` (listing processes) first. Test their resource usage on a real Termux installation.
5.  **API First Development:** Build and test the REST API endpoints using `curl` or Postman before writing a single line of HTMX.
6.  **UI Mockups:** Sketch the key pages (Dashboard, Apps Manager) on a mobile screen wireframe. Then implement them with Tailwind.
7.  **Integration:** Connect the HTMX frontend to the API endpoints, progressively enhancing the static HTML.
8.  **Alpha Testing:** rigorous testing on a real Android device with Termux and a Raspberry Pi Zero.

This design provides a robust, professional foundation for the **Termux Panel** project. It is ambitious yet pragmatic, with a clear path from a minimal viable product to a powerful, community-driven platform.

## **Project Phasing: A Strategy for Momentum**

Here is a proposed breakdown into independent phases. Completing each phase will give you a working piece of the system and a boost of motivation.

### **Phase 0: Project Foundation & Bootstrapping**
*   **Goal:** Create the barebones structure and prove the core concept works on Termux.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Initialize Git repository.
    2.  Create `package.json` with core dependencies (`express`, `lowdb`).
    3.  Create basic `app.js` that starts an Express server.
    4.  Serve a single static HTML page with "Hello World".
    5.  Create a simple `bin/start.sh` script to run the server.
    6.  **Test it:** Run this on Termux. Confirm you can access `http://localhost:3000` from your phone's browser.
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"It lives! The server runs on Termux!"**

### **Phase 1: The API Core & Data Layer**
*   **Goal:** Build the backend engine. No UI yet.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create the `data/` directory and initialize `lowdb` with `config.json` and a skeleton `registry.json`.
    2.  Create `src/services/` directory with `MonitorService.js` and `Pm2Service.js`.
    3.  Implement API endpoints in `src/api/`:
        *   `GET /api/system/stats`
        *   `GET /api/system/processes`
        *   `GET /api/apps` (just returns a static JSON for now)
    4.  Test all endpoints rigorously with `curl` or Postman.
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"The API is alive! I can curl for system stats!"**

### **Phase 2: The Static UI Framework**
*   **Goal:** Build the frontend shell that doesn't depend on live data.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Integrate Tailwind CSS. Build a basic `public/css/styles.css`.
    2.  Create the main `layout.html` with a responsive mobile-first navigation bar.
    3.  Create static HTML "pages" in `public/views/` for `dashboard.html`, `system.html`, `apps.html`, etc. They will be placeholder cards and tables with no real data.
    4.  Set up Express to serve these static files and use `res.sendFile()` for the main pages.
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"It looks like a real panel! Navigation works!"**

### **Phase 3: HTMX Integration & Dynamic Dashboard**
*   **Goal:** Make the UI dynamic. This is where the magic starts.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Include HTMX via CDN in your `layout.html`.
    2.  Replace the static content in `dashboard.html` with HTMX attributes:
        *   `hx-get="/api/system/stats" hx-trigger="load every 10s"` to populate the stats.
        *   A placeholder table for apps that will be populated via another `hx-get`.
    3.  Create small HTML fragments (e.g., `stats-partial.html`) that your API endpoints can return. The API now needs to support returning either JSON *or* HTML based on the `Accept` header.
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"The dashboard updates by itself! This is sorcery!"**

### **Phase 4: App Manager Core Functionality**
*   **Goal:** The most complex part. Create, Read, Update, Delete apps via PM2.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Finalize the `registry.json` schema.
    2.  Build the `AppManagerService` to interface with PM2's API (`pm2.list`, `pm2.start`, `pm2.stop`).
    3.  Implement full CRUD API endpoints for `/api/apps`.
    4.  Update the `apps.html` view to use HTMX to fetch and display the list of apps from the new API.
    5.  Implement "Start", "Stop", and "Restart" buttons that use `hx-post` to call the API and refresh the app list.
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"I can control processes from my browser! I've built a core feature!"**

### **Phase 5: Logs & Advanced Features**
*   **Goal:** Add real-time features and polish.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for `/api/logs/:app_id`.
    2.  Build the logs UI page to connect to the SSE stream and display tailing logs.
    3.  Implement the Tunnel manager (e.g., programmatically run `npx localtunnel --port 3000`).
    4.  Add a settings page to change the panel's port and other configs (persisted to `config.json` via lowdb).
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"Logs stream in real-time! The panel is now powerful!"**

### **Phase 6: Polish, Testing, & Release**
*   **Goal:** Prepare for public release.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Write the `README.md`** based on all the completed work.
    2.  Create an installer script (`bin/install.sh`).
    3.  Add error handling and toasts for user feedback.
    4.  Test on multiple devices: Termux, Raspberry Pi, a cheap VPS.
    5.  Create a sample `registry.json` with 2-3 popular apps (e.g., FileBrowser, a simple Node server).
    6.  Version Tag (v1.0.0) and Release.
*   **Milestone Achievement:** 🎉 **"v1.0.0 is out! The project is complete and shareable!"**

---

### **Phase 4: App Manager Core Functionality (Sub-Phased)**

**Overall Goal:** Build the entire Apps Manager backend and frontend with CRUD operations, installation, and lifecycle management.

---

### **Phase 4.1: Data Schema & LowDB Service Layer**
*   **Goal:** Define the structure and create the service to manage it. No UI, no APIs yet.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create the `data/` directory and the `registry.json` file with a sample app (e.g., a simple HTTP server).
    2.  Create `src/services/DbService.js` with methods to read from `registry.json` and to read/write to a new `apps.json` (for user instances).
*   **Milestone:** 🎉 **"Data structure is defined! We can read/write app data programmatically."**

### **Phase 4.2: The AppManagerService Core (Backend Brain)**
*   **Goal:** Build the class that contains all the logic for installing, configuring, and managing apps via PM2.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create `src/services/AppManagerService.js`.
    2.  Implement the `getAllApps()` method to combine registry and installed apps.
    3.  Implement the `installApp(appId, userConfig)` method with its validation and PM2 integration.
    4.  Implement `startApp`, `stopApp`, `restartApp`, and `uninstallApp` methods.
*   **Milestone:** 🎉 **"The engine is built! We can install and control an app via a Node.js script."**

### **Phase 4.3: Apps API Endpoints**
*   **Goal:** Create the HTTP interface for the frontend to talk to the `AppManagerService`.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Create `src/api/apps-api.js`.
    2.  Implement `GET /api/apps`, `GET /api/apps/registry`, `POST /api/apps`, and `POST /api/apps/:id/:action` endpoints.
    3.  Integrate the router into `app.js`.
*   **Milestone:** 🎉 **"The API is live! We can control apps via HTTP calls (e.g., using curl or Postman)."**

### **Phase 4.4: Frontend - Installed Apps List & Controls**
*   **Goal:** Build the part of the UI that shows already installed apps and lets you control them.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Modify `public/views/apps.html` to have an "Installed Apps" section.
    2.  Use HTMX to call `GET /api/apps` and dynamically populate the list.
    3.  Add Start, Stop, Restart, Delete buttons that call the respective API endpoints and refresh the list.
*   **Milestone:** 🎉 **"We have a working UI! I can see my apps and control them from the browser!"**

### **Phase 4.5: Frontend - App Registry & Installation Modal**
*   **Goal:** Build the UI for discovering available apps and installing them.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  Add an "Available Apps" section to `apps.html`.
    2.  Use HTMX to fetch `GET /api/apps/registry` and list the apps.
    3.  Create the modal partial (`install-modal.html`) and the dynamic form for configuration.
    4.  Make the "Install" button open the modal and submit the form to `POST /api/apps`.
*   **Milestone:** 🎉 **"The app store is open! I can discover and install new apps from the UI with a click!"**
